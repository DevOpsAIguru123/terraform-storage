# Azure Hub-Spoke Network with Databricks and Unity Catalog Setup

## Overview

This repository contains the Terraform configurations for deploying a **complex network architecture** in Azure based on the **Hub-Spoke topology**. The architecture supports a secure, scalable infrastructure, with **Databricks workspaces** and **Azure Firewalls** for traffic control and **Unity Catalog** storage integration.

The key components of this infrastructure include:

- **Azure Hub-Spoke Network** with peerings
- **Azure Firewall** for managing traffic
- **Databricks Workspaces** in the Spoke VNet
- **Unity Catalog** storage for managing environments across Sandbox, Dev, Acceptance, and Production

The deployment is automated using **Terraform Enterprise** for state management and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

## Architecture Overview

### Hub-Spoke Network

- **Hub VNet**: Manages shared resources and centralized traffic routing.
- **Spoke VNet**: Hosts Databricks workspaces and specific workloads with segregated subnets.
- **Peering**: Hub and Spoke VNets are peered to allow communication.

### VNet Configuration

| VNet Name   | Resource Group   | Subnets                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hub VNet    | `<Hub-RG-Name>`   | `FirewallSubnet`                         |
| Spoke VNet  | `<Spoke-RG-Name>` | `PublicSubnet`, `PrivateSubnet`, `OpenAISubnet` |

- **FirewallSubnet**: Deployed in the Hub VNet to control traffic.
- **PublicSubnet**, **PrivateSubnet**, and **OpenAISubnet**: Deployed in the Spoke VNet for respective workloads.

### Azure Firewall

- Deployed in the **FirewallSubnet** of the Hub VNet.
- Controls **inbound** and **outbound** traffic based on rules defined in the Terraform configurations.

### Databricks Workspaces

- 4 Databricks workspaces are deployed in the **Spoke VNet**.
- Each workspace is associated with different environments.

| Databricks Workspace Name   | URL                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `<Databricks-Workspace-1>`   | `https://<workspace1>.azuredatabricks.net`    |
| `<Databricks-Workspace-2>`   | `https://<workspace2>.azuredatabricks.net`    |
| `<Databricks-Workspace-3>`   | `https://<workspace3>.azuredatabricks.net`    |
| `<Databricks-Workspace-4>`   | `https://<workspace4>.azuredatabricks.net`    |

### Unity Catalog Storage

A single **Unity Catalog Storage Account** is created to manage data for Databricks Unity Catalogs. Each environment has its own storage container.

- **Storage Account Name**: `<Unity-Catalog-SA-Name>`

| Environment | Container Name       | External Location                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Sandbox     | `<sandbox-container>` | `<sandbox-external-location>`     |
| Dev         | `<dev-container>`     | `<dev-external-location>`         |
| Acceptance  | `<acceptance-container>`| `<acceptance-external-location>` |
| Prod        | `<prod-container>`    | `<prod-external-location>`        |

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository leverages **GitHub Actions** for automated Terraform deployments. It includes workflows for validating, planning, and applying changes across different environments (Sandbox, Dev, Acceptance, Prod).

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **GitHub Action Name**: `<GitHub-Action-Name>`
  - Runs the Terraform workflows for each environment.
  - Provides continuous integration and automated deployment pipelines for infrastructure changes.

### Terraform Workspaces

- Separate **Terraform workspaces** are used for each environment to isolate the state and manage infrastructure independently.
  
| Environment  | Terraform Workspace Name |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Sandbox      | `<sandbox-workspace>`     |
| Dev          | `<dev-workspace>`         |
| Acceptance   | `<acceptance-workspace>`  |
| Prod         | `<prod-workspace>`        |

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>

	2.	Configure Azure Authentication:
	•	Ensure you have the required Azure credentials and access to the Resource Groups.
	3.	Run Terraform Init to initialize the backend:

terraform init


	4.	Run Terraform Plan to preview the infrastructure changes:

terraform plan -var-file=<env>.tfvars


	5.	Run Terraform Apply to deploy the infrastructure:

terraform apply -var-file=<env>.tfvars


	6.	Monitor the GitHub Actions pipeline for any deployments or changes triggered by commits to the repository.

Important Notes

	•	Ensure that you are using the correct Terraform workspace for each environment to avoid conflicts.
	•	The Firewall rules and VNet peering must be reviewed regularly for optimal performance and security.
	•	Unity Catalog storage should be managed carefully to maintain environment isolation.
